... Default notifications will not ring the phone until screen is turned on.  To override that behavior, set priority: 
high and ttl: 0.  By default they also do not override "Do Not Disturb" settings, if you would like to override this 
you will need to use "notification channels".

- "Alarm Stream"
You can also force the notification to play from the alarm stream so it will make the device ring even if on vibrate/silent
ringer mode. Users on Android 7 and below can still use the channel example below as we are just using it to override the
default notification behavior for sound. In order to make a notification show up immediately and make a sound regardless of
ringer mode follow one of the examples below.

Example 1:
automations:
  - alias: "Fire Detected Android alarm stream"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.smoke_alarm
        to: "smoke"

    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device_id_here>
        data:
          title: "Wake up!"
          message: "The house is on fire and the cat's stuck in the dryer!"
          data:
            ttl: 0
            priority: high
            channel: alarm_stream
			

Example 2 - "Text To Speech Alarm Stream" to speak the notification:

automations:
  - alias: "Fire Detected TTS alarm"

    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.smoke_alarm
        to: "smoke"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device_id_here>
        data:
          title: "The house is on fire and the cat's stuck in the dryer!"
          message: TTS
          data:
            ttl: 0
            priority: high
            channel: alarm_stream


Example 3 - "Text To Speech Alarm Stream Max Volume" to make the notification speak as loud as it can, then revert back
original volume level:

automations:
  - alias: "Fire Detected TTS loud"

    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.smoke_alarm
        to: "smoke"

    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device_id_here>
        data:
          title: "The house is on fire and the cat's stuck in the dryer!"
          message: "TTS"
          data:
            ttl: 0
            priority: high
            channel: alarm_stream_max



# Basic Example:
automations:
  - alias: "Fire Detected android"

    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.smoke_alarm
        to: "smoke"

    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_<your_device_id_here>
        data:
          title: "Wake up!"
          message: "The house is on fire and the cat's stuck in the dryer!"
          data:
            ttl: 0
            priority: high
-----------------------------------------
# bg modified for me:
automations:
  - alias: "Mailbox door opened"

# This section needs to be update with the correct info.  Need to create the entity_id, what is "to:" ??
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.smoke_alarm
        to: "smoke"

    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app_moto_g_power_2021
        data:
          title: "Check Mailbox"
          message: "Check for deliveries from Aliexpress?"
          data:
            ttl: 0
            priority: high
